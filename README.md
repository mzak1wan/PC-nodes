## Installation
The fastest way to run the code is to use `poetry`, which can be installed from [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).  

After cloning the repository on your computer, you can go to the pc-node folder with `cd path_to_the_folder/pc-node`.  
You can then run `poetry install` to install all the required dependencies.  
Once the dependencies are installed, you can for example run jupyter-lab with `poetry run jupiter lab`.
